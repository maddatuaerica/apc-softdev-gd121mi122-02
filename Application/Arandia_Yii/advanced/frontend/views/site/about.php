	<h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        In 1999, Mr. Roselio R. Arandia & Dr. Yolanda DC. Arandia were offered to purchase a lot at 
		Lot 1 Blk. 1 F. Valarao St., Airport Village, Moonwalk by Mrs. Josefina Roxas, then owner of the said property. 
		The spouses initially refused to accept the offer as they had no plans to develop the property or use it for business, at the time. 
		As it happened, Mrs. Ma. Isabel Valerio, a family friend proposed to the Arandia spouses to put up a pre-school learning center in their garage. 
		Dr. Amaro E. Escario, who was then a retired District Supervisor of the Department of Education was asked by Dr. Arandia for assistance in putting up the Pre-school. 
		However, the experienced educator insisted that it should be a complete system - Pre-school, Elementary and Secondary levels. 
		The spouses agreed to the proposal of Dr. Escario and so ARANDIA ACADEMY, INC was founded. 
		Today, the ARANDIA COLLEGE, INC. system is a leading educational institution in southern Metro Manila but it did not grow overnight. 
		The school has evolved through 14 years of persistent praying, waiting, planning and staffing. 
		AC started Pre-school levels in 1999 with its first batch of 56 students and 8 faculty members. 
		The school was able to acquire additional 5 lots adjacent to the original school campus.
